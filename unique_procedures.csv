Selective arteriography of thoracic and brachial arteries with additional images is typically performed by an interventional radiologist or a vascular surgeon and may require some preparation such as fasting or discontinuing certain medications.

During the procedure, a catheter is inserted into an artery, typically in the groin, and guided through the blood vessels to the target area of the thoracic and brachial arteries. A contrast dye is then injected into the catheter to make the arteries visible on X-ray images. The procedure may involve taking additional images from different angles to obtain a detailed view of the arteries.

Selective arteriography of thoracic and brachial arteries with additional images is typically performed by an interventional radiologist or a vascular surgeon and may require some preparation such as fasting or discontinuing certain medications.

During the procedure, a catheter is inserted into an artery, typically in the groin, and guided through the blood vessels to the target area of the thoracic and brachial arteries. A contrast dye is then injected into the catheter to make the arteries visible on X-ray images. The procedure may involve taking additional images from different angles to obtain a detailed view of the arteries.

Selective arteriography of thoracic and brachial arteries with additional images is typically performed by an interventional radiologist or a vascular surgeon and may require some preparation such as fasting or discontinuing certain medications.
